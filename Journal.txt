Journal.txt - Log File to document this project.


1st January, 2021:
  Been thinking about this project for some time, but it is now time to start documenting it and thinking more concretely about what I will be doing.
  The idea is that a pair of lamps can communicate across the internet - one sets a colour which is sent to the other lamp so that both can be synchronised.

  There will be three essential parts of this project:
    1) The Base
    2) The Lamp
    3) The Server
  The Base (1):
    - Connected to power and to WIFI.
    - Serves as an intermediary between the Lamp and the Server.
    - Is able to charge the battery of the Lamp
  The Lamp (2):
    - Contains a battery, can be charged by the Base or can act within the base.
    - Communicates with the base through IR (or similar technology).
    - Contains a light globe that can change colour and brightness.
    - Contains a microcontroller which can process the logic of the lamp:
      - The lamp should have several available colours.
      - The user can change the colour of their lamp through some physical UI.
      - They can then export the new colour to the Server which can be loaded on the second lamp.
      - Alternatively, they can import the current colour kept on the Server and load that onto their lamp.
    - Hopefully is a nice lamp which looks pretty good.
  The Server (3):
    - Communicates with the base of both lamps in the pair.
    - Stores locally the current colour, broadcasts it across the internet.
    - Accepts requests from either base to update the stored colour.


  Current Difficulties:
    1) Working out the lamp itself.
      - I have experimented with purchasing an RGB lamp (a lot of smart globes are available) and attempting to tinker with them so that they're usable.
          I have a Lenovo Smart Globe that was reasonably cheap.
          It seemed that to dissassemble it I would have to essentially break it - not a good option.
          The only way to use such a globe, I think, would be to somehow communicate with its existing microcontroller through software.
              This globe has an app bound to it and appears to be able to connect to wifi so I could potentially make a software oriented solution, rather
              than programming my own microcontroller.
              May be easier, but definitely less fun - I would be avoiding all of the microcontroller work which I would really like to explore more.
              But that remains an option: Writing some software pretending to be the Lenovo App (which may be easier said than done), removing the need for a custom microcontroller on the lamp.

      - The other option seems to be to make an RGB globe from scratch.
          It is certainly possible to have an LED for each RGB (3) and varying their relative intensity to create different colours.
          This article seems to break this process down: https://circuitdigest.com/electronic-circuits/rgb-light-circuit-diagram
          This article varies the duty cycle of each LED to create different colours. The LEDS are bound to a 555 timer IC which creates a "pulse of variable width"
          Changing the width of the pulse changes the duty cycle (the proportion of ON time to total time in a cycle) which changes the perceived brightness of the LED.
          The length of the 555 timer pulses is controlled through a couple of resistors and capacitors - the duty cycle can be changed using a variable resistor.
          Would need to find a way to electronically vary a resistance:
            Variable resistors change resistance mechanically, so it would be best to have a series of fixed resistors for each preset colour and the microcontroller can select which preset
            of resistors should be used in each timer. An EPROM might be useful here, as would transistors. Would be possible using a combination of both.

          More challenging seems to guarentee the other condition of the build - the light actually being nice.
            Would need fairly high power LEDs and some sort of globe? Might be useful to break an LED light globe anyway to get a sense of what actual LEDS are used in them.
              Might try to buy a really cheap LED light globe just to break and examine.

              The article has a video attached where the person uses the circuit to make an RGB lamp. They simply place a light globe over the three standard LEDS and it looks pretty good.
              Might be able to just do that...
              Definitely worth testing the circuit the article proposes with mechanically variable resistors.

              I also still have some 555 timers which will help. They call the basic circuit idea a "PWM LED Dimmer Circuit".
              I do have 3 555 timers (exactly enough for this circuit!) - I will attach their datasheet to this git under "Research".


              I think I will ensure I experiment with the circuit so that I'm not just copying down something from the internet.
              I think I need some new components for this (prototyping) - mainly LEDS, resistors and capacitors I think.

              The 555 timer is also proving very difficult to use generally, mostly because I don't really understand much of the talk in the data sheet.
              After watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CvpP1PaQKo0, I have realised that I was focussing too much on the monostable function of the 555,
              which is just very different to what I thought it was. I do actually definitely want the astable operation.

              Most important results from the datasheet associated with astable operation are:

              t_H = 0.693(R_A + R_B)C
              t_L = 0.693(R_B)C
              period = t_H + t_L = 0.693(R_A + 2R_B)C = P
              frequency =  1/period = f

              So, for testing purposes it would be useful to have a cycle that can actually be seen.
              Therefore, t_H would be good to be around a second.

              I currently have a capacitor of 1nF, so to be off for 1s:
              1 = 0.693(R_B)1*10^-9 or R_B=1/(0.693*10^-9)=1.4G ohms
              I.e. using my capacitor, R_B = t_L/(0.693*10^-9)

              I don't think I have a resistor of that resistance though... The big difference is the capacitor.

              It may be more useful to conduct the necessary calculations to determine which colours will be delivered by which combinations before I order parts.



              Various colours and their codes: (lets have 8 (and white lol) )
              1) Lavender (230, 230, 250) -> (0.9019, 0.9019, 0.9304)
              2) Pale yellow (255, 255, 237) -> (1, 1, 0.9294)
              3) Powder blue (176, 224, 230) -> (0.6902, 0.8784, 0.9020)
              4) Warm orange (255, 127, 80) -> (1, 0.4980, 0.3137)
              5) Pink (255, 192, 203) -> (1, 0.7529, 0.7961)
              6) Lime green (50, 205, 50) -> (0.1961, 0.8039, 0.1961)
              7) Deep red (130, 22, 61) -> (0.5098, 0.0863, 0.2343)
              8) Deep blue (56, 67 162) -> (0.2196, 0.2627, 0.6353)
              9) White (255, 255, 255) -> (1, 1, 1)

              The 555 circuit requires 2 fixed capacitors. One is reccomended to be 0.01micro Farads, the other is variable.
              I should pick a capacitor that allows for the resistors to not be too nasty.

              The ratios the resistors need to be in are shown beside the colours.
              A 555 timer needs to be configured for each LED, and they must all have the same period.
              period = t_H + t_L = 0.693(R_A + 2R_B)C

              Therefore, the relative intensities listed after each colour represents the fraction of the period that the light is on (t_h/period)
              The period should be locked. Lets say 10ms. (small enough not to notice flickering, hopefully)

              Therefore, for each colour:
              P = 10ms
              C = constant
              P = 0.693(R_A + 2R_B)C
              t_H/P = ratio to vary
              t_H/P = 0.693(R_A+R_B)C/(0.693(R_A + 2R_B)C) = (R_A + R_B)/(R_A + 2R_B)
              Are all values of t_H/P accessible from a locked R_A and a free R_B (or vice versa)?
                NO! The curve y = (x+a)/(X+2a) has a horizontal asymptote at y=a for positive x, with a minimum value (for positive x) of 0.5.
              Unfortunately we need to be able to access t_H/P < 0.5, in a few cases.
              More concerning, that seems to indicate that no combination delivers t_h/P<0.5

              The challenge is: picking the fewest resistors possible to ensure that P*(R_A + R_B)/(R_A + 2R_B) = each number in the colour list.
              This would be easier if I didn't want to pick such nice colours - everything would just be in simple ratios...
              THat's ok. I might try a python script just to see what I'm working with.


6th January 2021:
  Been thinking more about how to progress from last time.
    An assortment of resistors doesn't seem like a particularly efficient way to do this - I would need a lot which would clutter the board
    unless they can be bought in smaller packages than usual.
    I could either remove some of the accuracy from my colour duty cycle ratios and/or I could remove the requirement for a consistent period.
    I do not actually need to care about the period, as long as it is sufficiently small (in the order of a few ms)
        The duty cycle ratios only need to be evident for about the smallest time interval the eye can distinguish
            Not that long, but not necessarily all the same number.

    Hence, I will drop the period consistency requirement from my analysis.
      Though I'm unsure it makes a difference as t_H/P is still the quantity to vary even if P can change...


10th January 2021:
  We can use a NOT IC to access the entire t_H/P range. Will then just reduce the accuracy of the ratios.
  Ez.
  The only requirement is that we reduce the number of required ratios, so we can be a bit more intelligent about THat
  than just blindly removing the accuracy of my ratios.
  Where there is a subtle difference, the difference can be maintained with some accuracy. If there is a small difference
  between different colours, this could be averaged to make a less meaningful change (or if a ratio is sufficiently different from the other colours
  its accuracy is probably less important.)
  This is unless there's a better way to digitally control voltage or similar across the globes. This seems one of the best ways though.


  First revision:
  Lavender: (0.9, 0.9, 0.93)
  Pale yellow: (1, 1, 0.93)
  Powder blue: (0.7, 0.88, 0.9)
  Warm orange: (1, 0.5, 0.3)
  Pink: (1, 0.7, 0.8)
  Lime green: (0.2, 0.8, 0.2)
  Deep red: (0.5, 0.88, 0.22)
  Deep blue: (0.22, 0.26, 0.7) - Problematic
  White: (1, 1, 1)

  Which reduces to 13 different ratios from 19.

19th January 2021:
  First thing, I can definitely not just use a NOT IC to access the whole t_H/P range.
  I can't invert a resistance.

  In other news, I've taken apart a light globe and it wasn't too hard but I've unforunately removed some of the
  diffusing paint in the process.

  Other thing to do today is to improve the resistors script so that I can choose some basic components to test with.
  Also buying microcontrollers now.

  Ok I remembered what I meant about the inverter. I meant we can invert the duty cycle. If the duty cycle is 60% then we get 40% using an inverter.
  Silly me.

  Using my program, its clear that for testing purposes I would want a capacitor of about 0.001 Farads
  But for the actual product to have a period of about 10ms I would want:
  C = 0.00001 farads (10E-5) for larger resistor in the 1kohm region.


  Might figure out the resistors that would be best now using:
  First revision:
  Lavender: (0.9, 0.9, 0.93)
  Pale yellow: (1, 1, 0.93)
  Powder blue: (0.7, 0.88, 0.9)
  Warm orange: (1, 0.5, 0.3)
  Pink: (1, 0.7, 0.8)
  Lime green: (0.2, 0.8, 0.2)
  Deep red: (0.5, 0.88, 0.22)
  Deep blue: (0.22, 0.26, 0.7) - Problematic
  White: (1, 1, 1)

    0.9: R_A = 2000, R_B = 250
    0.93: R_A = 2000, R_B = 150
    0.7: R_A = 2000, R_B = 1500
    0.88: R_A = 2000, R_B = 300
    0.5: R_A = 150, R_B = 2000 (the largest difference possible will get closest to 0.5 - asymptote)
    0.3: invert 0.7
    0.8: R_A  = 2000, R_B = 650
    0.2: invert 0.8
    0.22: invert 0.78: R_A = 2000, R_B = 800
    0.26: invert 0.74: R_A = 2000, R_B = 1100

    In total the resistances therefore are:
      2000, 250, 150, 1500, 300, 650, 800, 1100 (ohms)
      Which aren't that many!

    Now I need to put thought into the actual arrangement of these resistors to figure out how many I realistically need.
    The key idea is that a the microcontroller can vary the resistance by choosing which resistors to use. Luckily, R_A only has two options at this point: 2000 or 150.
    And R_B has all the rest.
    If each resistor has a diode on the end of it and a transistor connected to the microcontroller, the microcontroller should be able to choose which resistor to use.
    Will have to test this concept by buying the relevant stuff:
      Next shopping cart:
        (Jaycar)
        - 2 Microcontrollers (I've found one which looks good and is very cheap (fair enough only needs to be 8 bit!))
        - 8 2kohm resistors (smallest packet)
        - 8 300ohm resistors
        - 8 150ohm resistors
        - 8 1.5kohm resistors
        - 8 1.1kohm resistors
        Jokes. These resistors are too small and annoying. (I also can't use them for anything else if they're this low)

        The capacitor is moving up to 10E-6F and the resistors are moving up 1 place value.
        New total resistances:
        20k, 2.5k, 1.5k, 15k, 3k, 6.5k, 8k, 11k ohms
        Shopping cart:
        - 2 microcontrollers
        - 8 20k resistors
        - 8 1.5k resistors
        - 8 1k resistors (can add to 1.5k to make 2.5k)
        - 8 15k resistors
        - 8 3k resistors
        - 8 6.8k resistors (replacing 6.5k)
        - 8 8.2k resistors (replacing 8k)
        - 8 11k resistors
        - 2 1 uFarad capacitors
        - 1 100uFarad capacitor (for testing - period of about 1s)
        - 3xAA battery holder (Cuz I needed a better power supply gr - just for this, will use better one later)
        - 10 NPN transistors (to control current flow)
        $23.85 - ordered!
