.TH ASEM 1 "31 December 2002" "ASEM-51 V1.3" "ASEM-51 Macro Assembler"
.SH NAME
asem \-  assemble an 8051 assembly language program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B asem
[options] source [object [listing]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B asem
is a two\-pass macro assembler for the
.B Intel MCS\-51
family of microcontrollers.
.SH FILES
.B source
is the 8051 assembler source,
.B object
is the output file, and
.B listing
is the assembler list file.
.br
All file names that are specified explicitly, are left unchanged.
The parameters
.B object
and
.B listing
are optional. When omitted, the
.B object
file name is derived from the
.B source
file name, but with extension
.IR ".hex" " (or " ".omf"
if the
.B \-o
option is set). When the
.B listing
file name is omitted, it is derived from the
.B object
file name, but with extension
.IR ".lst" "."
.br
The maximum length of a file parameter is limited to 255 characters!
.SH OPTIONS
.B asem
recognizes the following options:
.sp
.B \-i path1:path2:path3
.br
.B \-\-includes=path1:path2:path3
.br
.RS
specifies a search path for include files that cannot be found
in the working directory
.RE
.sp
.B \-d symbol[:value[:type]]
.br
.B \-\-define=symbol[:value[:type]]
.br
.RS
defines a symbol with an optional
.B value
and segment
.B type
(C, D, I, X, B, N). Defaults: value=0, type=N
.RE
.sp
.BR "\-o" ", " "\-\-omf\-51"
.br
.RS
generate an object file in absolute OMF\-51 format
.RE
.sp
.BR "\-c" ", " "\-\-columns"
.br
.RS
output additional column numbers after the line numbers
of program error messages
.RE
.sp
.BR "\-v" ", " "\-\-verbose"
.br
.RS
output additional product, version, and error summary information
.RE
.sp
Long options may be abbreviated as long as they remain unique.
All option names are case\-sensitive!
.SH ENVIRONMENT
To specify a search path for include files, an optional environment variable
.B ASEM51INC
can be defined. The assembler searches the specified search path for
include files that can neither be found in the working directory,
nor in the search path specified with the
.B \-\-includes
option.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
When terminating,
.B asem
returns an exit code to the calling process:
.sp
.RS
.BR 0 "    no errors"
.br
.BR 1 "    program errors detected"
.br
.BR 2 "    fatal runtime error"
.RE
.sp
Note: Warnings do not influence the returned exit code!
.SH USAGE
For detailed information on writing
.B 8051
assembly language programs see the
.B ASEM\-51 User's Manual
in ASCII file
.IR "asem_51.doc" ","
or start reading with HTML file
.IR "docs.htm" "!"
.SH "CONFORMING TO"
The
.B ASEM\-51
assembly language is a rich subset of the
.B Intel standard
that guarantees maximum compatibility with existing
.B 8051
assembler sources. It can generate two sorts of object files:
.B Intel\-HEX
format, which is directly accepted by most EPROM programmers, and absolute
.B Intel OMF\-51
format (with debug information), which is required for many simulators,
emulators and target debuggers.
